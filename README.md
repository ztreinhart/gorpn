# gorpn
Command line RPN calculator implemented in Go.

# Building
On a system with a recent version of Go installed:
  - Unzip the source package
  - Change directory into the source directory
  - Execute 'go build'
This should result in a binary called 'gorpn' in the source directory.
Tested on MacOS 10.14 with Go 1.14.3 and Ubuntu 20.04 with Go 1.13.8.
